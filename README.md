# Abstract
This project uses the Kernel SVM model to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign, with a 94.3% accuracy.
Developed by Magnus Aghe as part of the Machine Learning Deployment course AN680 at National University, San Diego, CA.
The model uses the four most correlated features with tumor class namely:- Bare Nuclei (bare_nuclei), Uniformity of cell shape (uniformity_cell_shape), Uniformity of cell size (uniformity_cell_size), and Bland Chromatin (bland_chromatin).
Dataset used is Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original
